To use Firebase credentials:

1. Download your service account JSON file from Firebase Console
2. Save it somewhere safe (NOT in your project folder)
3. Copy the values from the JSON file into your .env file
4. Delete or securely store the JSON file (never commit it to git)

Your .env file should look like this:
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=nomad
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your-key-id-here
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour-key-here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@nomad-xxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com

And so on for all the values...
