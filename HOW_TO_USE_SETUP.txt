# Example of how to use the setup script:
# 
# 1. Download your Firebase service account key as nomad-key.json
# 2. Move it to a safe location (like your Downloads folder)
# 3. Run this command:
#
# node setup_firebase.js ~/Downloads/nomad-key.json
#
# 4. The script will automatically update your .env file
# 5. Start your server: npm start
#
# SECURITY: After setup, you can delete the nomad-key.json file
